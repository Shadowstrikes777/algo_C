# Algorithmic training

Hey, if you are here to learn about algorithmic programing like me,
you are in the right place because these are series of exercices to
reinforce your algorithmic understanding.

## Future aspects

In the future I will be trying to make this repository more structured
overtime.

## You can help too

I'm still an humble beginner in the aspects of git, so I don t know much
about contributions, forking and all that stuff. But I am very open for
suggestions, and for helping too. You can contact me at 
**mmaevani@student.42antananarivo.mg**.
Expect me to progress and make this a better place.
